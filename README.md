# Noise-l2
Developed in the Machine Learning course by: Fernanda Avenda√±o, Diego Quezada and Kevin Reyes.
## Objectives:
- Verify the equivalence of the white noise application and the use of the regularizer $L_2$.

## Description
The equivalence of the application of white noise and the use of the $L_2$ regularizer is investigated using three different data sets.

## Conclusions
- The performance of the models when applying white noise or regularizer $L_2$ is practically the same on average.
- In the three data sets there are $\lambda$ values such that the effectiveness of the models, measured through the MSE, is the same.

## Technology stack: 
- Numpy.
- Pandas.
- Scikit-learn.
- Matplotlib.
- Seaborn.
